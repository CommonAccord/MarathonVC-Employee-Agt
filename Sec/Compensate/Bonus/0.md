Notwithstanding the foregoing, the {_Employee} shall in any event have no right to a bonus or a time-apportioned bonus if the {_Employee}’s employment terminates for any reason or the {_Employee} is under notice of termination (whether given by the {_Employee} or the {_Company}) at or before the date when a bonus might otherwise have been payable. Any bonus payment to the {_Employee} shall be purely discretionary and shall not form part of the {_Employee}’s contractual remuneration under this {_Agreement}. If the {_Company} makes a bonus payment to the {_Employee}, it shall not be obliged to make subsequent bonus payments.
